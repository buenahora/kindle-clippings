> Simple script for converting from CSV format to traditional "My Clippings.txt" format

## How to use?
Back up your highlights on [Clippings.io](https://www.clippings.io/). Next, export the highlights as "Excel 2003" or "Excel 2007". Using Excel, save this as a CSV file named "clippings_export.csv". Finally, run `python clippings.py` to get an "output.txt" folder in the desired format.
